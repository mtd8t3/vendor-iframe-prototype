# Vendor Tool Integration Prototype

This prototype demonstrates how to integrate EZLynx into our proprietary front-end UX via an iframe, using a reverse proxy to bypass X-Frame-Options restrictions.

## Current Implementation Status

✅ Successfully implemented a proof-of-concept that:
- Displays EZLynx login page in an iframe through our proxy
- Bypasses X-Frame-Options restrictions using a custom proxy server
- Demonstrates side-by-side comparison of direct iframe (fails) vs. proxied iframe (works)
- Successfully maintains proxy path structure for authentication handling

❌ Known issues to address:
- CSS styling issues persist - the login form displays but without proper styling
- Post-login redirects may still require additional handling for full functionality
- Some static resources (images, fonts) may not be loading correctly

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main application shell with side-by-side iframes for comparison
- `styles.css` - Styling for the prototype following our design aesthetic
- `proxy-server.js` - Node.js reverse proxy server bypassing X-Frame-Options restrictions
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies for the proxy server

## How the Proxy Works

Our proxy server uses the following techniques to enable iframe embedding:

1. **Header Manipulation**
   - Removes X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Adds CORS headers to allow resources to load
   
2. **Cookie Handling**
   - Rewrites cookie domains and paths
   - Passes cookies through to maintain authentication
   
3. **Redirect Handling**
   - Captures and rewrites redirects to maintain proxy path
   - Tracks and logs redirect activity for debugging

4. **Advanced Configuration**
   - Supports WebSockets for real-time features
   - Adds browser-like headers for authenticity
   - Follows redirects within the proxy

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the proxy server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
5. You'll see two iframes side-by-side:
   - Left: Direct integration (fails due to X-Frame-Options)
   - Right: Proxy-enabled integration (successfully shows EZLynx login, but with style issues)

## Next Logical Steps

1. **Fix CSS/Asset Loading Issues - PRIORITY**
   - Further investigate why CSS isn't loading properly despite content-type handling
   - Check network requests to identify which resources are failing to load
   - Consider analyzing EZLynx's CSS loading approach (internal vs. external sheets)
   - May need to implement CSS injection or resource rewriting for complete styling

2. **Solve Post-Authentication Redirect Issues**
   - Continue improving redirect handling after successful login
   - Add additional logging around authentication flow and redirects
   - Implement comprehensive session management

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Add specific error detection for authentication failures
   - Create appropriate fallback content when proxy fails
   - Implement user-friendly error messages

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Add caching for static assets to improve load times
   - Implement compression for bandwidth efficiency
   - Use connection pooling for improved response time

5. **Implement Comprehensive Authentication Flow**
   - Create a proper login mechanism that handles all redirects
   - Store and manage authentication tokens
   - Implement auto-login capabilities

## Current Achievement

The most significant achievement so far is successfully bypassing the X-Frame-Options restriction and displaying the EZLynx login page within our iframe. While styling issues persist, this proves the technical concept of using a proxy to integrate EZLynx into our proprietary UX.
